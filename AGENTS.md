# Agent Instructions — new-project

## Project structure
- `src/` — application code (`settings.py` is the single config entry point)
- `tests/` — pytest
- `data/` — runtime state (gitignored, mounted as a docker volume)
- `templates/` — static assets that ship inside the image
- `main.py` — thin entry point over `src/`

## Setup
All routine actions go through the `Makefile` — run `make help` to list targets.
```bash
make install           # create .venv and install dev/test deps
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in the values  (shortcut: make env)
```

## Running tests
```bash
make test              # runs .venv/bin/pytest
```

## Running the app
```bash
make run               # runs .venv/bin/python main.py
```

## Conventions
- All mutable state goes under `data/`.
- All config comes from ENV / `.env` (see `.env.example`).
- Credentials / addresses of our own services that the user provides go ONLY into
  `.env` (never into code, never via inline env vars); read them through `Settings`.
- No default/example credentials in code; missing ENV var → fail at startup.
- A default address is allowed ONLY for public third-party APIs (Google, GitHub).
  Addresses of self-hosted services have no default.
- Code comments are in English.
- All repeated actions (env setup, tests, run) go through `make` targets — add or
  extend a target instead of running ad-hoc commands.
- Python always runs inside a local `.venv`, created automatically by `make` on
  first use (`make test` / `make run` bootstrap it) — never the system Python.
- Tests are required for new code; in CI `build` depends on `test`.
- No `EXPOSE` in the Dockerfile — Traefik publishes the service via compose labels.
- The container runs as non-root user `app` (uid 1000) — the entrypoint starts as
  root, fixes `/app/data` ownership and drops privileges via gosu. Do not add a
  `USER` directive to the Dockerfile and do not remove the entrypoint.
